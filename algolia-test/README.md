This DEMO project is a part of Algolia's recruitment process, and was completed in 3-4 hours.

## To run the project, execute

### `npm start`

## description

The project was built on top of an InstantSearch template.

The following built-in algolia functions were used:

InstantSearch, Hits, SearchBox, Pagination, Highlight,  ClearRefinements, RefinementList, RatingMenu, Configure
Including a "clear all filter", three filters: actors, genre, rating.

I chose not to include the search speed, the user doesn't need that information.


On top of this some extra features were added:

- A responsive design (try to change the window size)
- Sticky navbar with animation
- A fallback image when the image fails to load
- A favicon
- A star showing function for the ratings

With more time available, I would add the following:

- A mobile friendly filter menu
- A "no results" page/text
- Making each hit box smaller, with an expand button to see more details
- Work more on the theme
